## Fields

The following fields are returned by `SELECT` queries:

`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource.


## Methods

The following methods are available for this resource:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Accessible by</th>
    <th>Required Params</th>
    <th>Optional Params</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#enable_service_backup"><CopyableCode code="enable_service_backup" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="exec" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-service_id"><code>service_id</code></a>, <a href="#parameter-endpoint"><code>endpoint</code></a>, <a href="#parameter-BackupPolicyName"><code>BackupPolicyName</code></a></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-timeout"><code>timeout</code></a></td>
    <td>Enables periodic backup of stateful partitions under this Service Fabric service. Enables periodic backup of stateful partitions which are part of this Service Fabric service. Each partition is backed up individually as per the specified backup policy description. In case the application, which the service is part of, is already enabled for backup then this operation would override the policy being used to take the periodic backup for this service and its partitions (unless explicitly overridden at the partition level). Note only C# based Reliable Actor and Reliable Stateful services are currently supported for periodic backup.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Parameters

Parameters can be passed in the `WHERE` clause of a query. Check the [Methods](#methods) section to see which parameters are required or optional for each operation.

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Datatype</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr id="parameter-endpoint">
    <td><CopyableCode code="endpoint" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>The service endpoint. (default: )</td>
</tr>
<tr id="parameter-service_id">
    <td><CopyableCode code="service_id" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>The identity of the service. This ID is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character. For example, if the service name is "fabric:/myapp/app1/svc1", the service identity would be "myapp~app1~svc1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous versions.</td>
</tr>
<tr id="parameter-timeout">
    <td><CopyableCode code="timeout" /></td>
    <td><code>integer (int64)</code></td>
    <td>The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
